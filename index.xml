      <description>I have managed to play what I believe to be the longest possible non-trivial game of Absurdle.
What is Absurdle (and what is Wordle)? Wordle is a game by Josh Wardle, in which you try to guess the secret five-letter word of the day. You have 6 guesses, and each time you make a guess, the game colors each of your letters either black ‚¨õÔ∏è, yellow üü®, or green üü©. A green letter means that you got that letter in the right position - i.</description>

      <description>Recently I designed a PCB and had it made and assembled by JLCPCB. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve ever done anything like this &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve designed circuits on paper, built them on breadboards, soldered circuits together on proto-board PCBs, but before this project I&amp;rsquo;d never used an EDA program, ordered PCBs, or gotten a board assembled by a manufacturer. I figure it&amp;rsquo;s worth writing up what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.
As of the time of writing, I haven&amp;rsquo;t received the assembled boards, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t a review of JLCPCB&amp;rsquo;s PCB or SMT services.</description>
