<p>In <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/177256-put-a-modern-sbc-into-an-original-ipad/log/188901-the-big-scary-touchscreen-connectors">my first project log</a>, I had designed a PCB for interfacing with the touchscreen digitizer, based around Atmel's mXT2952, which was the only device I managed to find that had:</p><ul><li>datasheets available</li><li>enough drive / sense pins for the iPad's screen (40 drive, 30 sense)</li><li>a reasonable minimum order quantity</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, the mXT2952 is a tiny 5mm x 10mm 162-pin BGA, with 0.5mm pitch. This is a tiny, tiny package, and they made it extremely dense -- many BGA chips have a few rows of pins, some blank spaces, then a few more rows of pins. To fit a trace between two pads, you need 3 mil traces and 3 or 3.5-mil spaces. To fit a via between four pads, you need vias that are less than 0.25mm diameter / 0.15mm drill. While there are some PCB manufacturers online that claim to have these specs, the cheapest I was able to find was about $150 according to their online quote form (others seemed to be $300 and up). When I engaged with the cheap one, they told me they couldn't actually do 0.15mm drill holes.</p><p>So I sat on this problem for a while, thinking maybe I'd eventually bite the bullet and spend several hundred dollars on a more expensive manufacturer.</p><p>The other night, I searched the web again for "capacitive touchscreen IC", and saw some results for the Goodix GT911 and GT9271. The latter is used in the <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineTab">Pinetab</a>, and it's one of the first touchscreen controllers I considered. However, the GT9271 only has 32 drive / 20 sense pins - not enough for the iPad's touchscreen, and the GT911 has even fewer.</p><p>Long ago, I had tried looking on the <a href="https://www.goodix.com/en/product/touch_screen_control_chip">Goodix webpage about their touchscreen controllers</a>, which indicates that they have controllers that should work for even larger displays. This page has zero links or product numbers on it, however.</p><p>I searched around to see if I could find a full listing of all the ICs in the gt9xx family, and searched for every part number I found. Eventually I stumbled on the GT9110 and GT9113 (which seem to be nearly pin-compatible). Both of these have datasheets available online (not from goodix.com, of course), were available for purchase on AliExpress, and have a reasonable 0.4mm-pitch 88-pin QFN package.</p><p>I've created a <a href="https://github.com/EvanKrall/ipad_touchscreen_driver_gt9113">new PCB design</a> based around the GT9113 (should work for the GT9110 also - some of the broken-out pins become NC on the 9110).</p><p>As always, if you have any feedback, please let me know!</p>
