<p>While I wait for my audio board and breakout boards to show up, I started working on the video output side of things.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi CM4 has four ways to output video:</p><ul><li>2x HDMI</li><li>2x MIPI DSI</li><li>1x DPI</li><li>1x Composite</li></ul><p>I need to convert these into three different formats (in order of priority):<br/></p><ol><li>LVDS (FPD-Link or OLDI maybe) for the LP097X02-SLA1 built-in display.</li><li>DisplayPort for powering 30-pin video dongles such as the <a href="https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MD098AM/A/apple-digital-av-adapter">Digital AV Adapter</a> (HDMI) or the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MC552AM/B/apple-vga-adapter">30-pin to VGA Adapter</a>.</li><li>Composite and/or S-Video for the 30-pin connector</li></ol><p>I'm not sure why Apple went with DisplayPort internally. I guess Macbook Pros of that era <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-2-duo-2.4-aluminum-13-mid-2010-unibody-specs.html#macspecs2">already had Mini DisplayPort</a> ports. HDMI is roughly as complicated as DisplayPort, though, and would have simplified their HDMI dongle without adding much complication to their VGA dongle, in my opinion.</p><p>Here are the various options for converter ICs I found:</p><table><thead><tr><th><br/></th><th>DisplayPort</th><th>LVDS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HDMI x2</td><td>STDP2600 (0.8mm BGA - doable?)</td><td>TFP401 (HTQFP) -&gt; SN65LVDS93 (TSSOP)<br/>ADV7613 (0.8mm BGA)<br/>RTD2668 (massive QFP)</td></tr><tr><td>MIPI DSI x2</td><td>SN65DSI86 (tiny BGA)<br/>SN65DSI86-Q1 (HTQFP)<br/>PS8640 (tiny BGA)<br/>TC358766X (tiny BGA)<br/>ANX7805 (tiny BGA)<br/></td><td>SN65DSI83 (tiny BGA)<br/>SN65DSI83-Q1 (HTQFP)</td></tr><tr><td>DPI x1 (Parallel RGB)</td><td>ANX9807 (0.8mm BGA)<br/>STDP4028 (0.8mm BGA)</td><td>SN65LVDS93 (TSSOP)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I think the SN65DSI86-Q1 and SN65DSI83-Q1 are my best bets:</p><ul><li>For some reason, MIPI seems like a simpler on-board video format than HDMI.</li><li>TI didn't have any single-chip solutions for HDMI -&gt; DP or HDMI -&gt; LVDS, and going with another manufacturer would ruin the TI hegemony I've found on my boards. (But actually, TI has pretty good datasheets and <a href="https://training.ti.com/introduction-sn65dsi83-sn65dsi84-and-sn65dsi85-dsi-lvds-bridges">training videos</a> and will sell you things in small quantities.)</li><li>QFP packages are pretty small, but will avoid the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/177256/log/188901">difficulties of tiny BGA packages</a>.</li><li>DPI would use up a lot of the GPIO pins.</li></ul><p>It's not nearly done yet, but I've started making progress on the <a href="https://github.com/EvanKrall/cm4_ipad_display_adapter">board for both LVDS and DisplayPort</a> (as of right now, I've mostly wired up the SN65DSI83-Q1 but haven't finished the LED backlight driver nor started on the DisplayPort side of things.)</p>
